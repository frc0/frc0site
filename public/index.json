The design process is a series of steps that engineers follow to design a product. The number of steps varies depending on who you ask, but the main point is that its a cycle. The design process is a cycle because it is not a linear process. Engineers will go back and forth between the steps as they work on the design. The design process is also iterative. This means that the design will be improved over time.\nAn example diagram of the design process is shown above.\nBelow is an outline of the topics that will be covered in this chapter.\nContents for this Chapter Order Page Title Time Estimate 2.1 Design Process 30 minutes 2.2 Design Brief 30 minutes 2.3 Design Constraints 30 minutes 2.4 Design Specifications 30 minutes 2.5 Design Requirements 30 minutes 2.6 Design Sketches 30 minutes 2.7 Design Models 30 minutes 2.8 Design Testing 30 minutes 2.9 Design Review 30 minutes 2.10 Design Iteration 30 minutes 2.11 Design Documentation 30 minutes 2.12 Design Presentation 30 minutes Total 6 hours "

The language that you choose to use will depend on your team\u0026rsquo;s preferences and the programming language that your mentors are most comfortable with. The programming language that you choose to use will also depend on the programming language that your team\u0026rsquo;s robot controller is programmed in. The robot controller is the computer that controls the robot. The robot controller is a NI RoboRio. The Roborio can be configured for any of the languages listed above.\nRobot code is also not the only type of programming done in FRC. Teams write GUI software for their drive stations, they make games in Unity and Unreal Engine, and they write code for their websites. Students also learn how to write low level firmware for devices like arduinos and raspberry pis. Programming is a very important part of FRC and students can come into FRC with little to no programming experience and leave with a very strong understanding of programming.

	"content": "Originally discovered by the ancient Greeks, pneumatics is the study of air pressure. Pneumatics is a branch of fluid power that uses compressed air to power actuators. Pneumatic actuators are used to move mechanical parts, such as valves, cylinders, and other devices. Pneumatic systems are used in a wide variety of applications, including robotics, manufacturing, and construction.\nIn FRC teams typically use cylinders to extend and retract a piston. This can be used to move a mechanism in a linear direction, or to rotate a mechanism. Cylinders are usually measured by the stroke length, bore diameter, and rod diameter. The stroke length is the distance the piston can travel in one direction. The bore diameter is the diameter of the cylinder. The rod diameter is the diameter of the piston. The bore and rod diameters are usually the same. They can also come in a large variety of sizes and styles.\nA typical pneumatic system in FRC can look something like this:\nImage courtesy of FRC 358\nBelow is a downloadable copy of FIRST\u0026rsquo;s pneumatics guide.

	"content": "Pneumatics are powerful and can be dangerous if not used properly. This section will cover the safety rules and guidelines for pneumatics. As is the case with all safety rules, they are not meant to be restrictive. They are meant to be guidelines to help keep you safe. If you have any questions about the safety rules, please ask your mentor or coach.\nSafety Rules Never use compressed air to propel a projectile. Never apply compressed air to the skin or direct it at a person. Even air at a pressure of 15 psig can cause serious injury. Never use a compressed air hose to clean dirt or dust from your clothing or body. Always wear safety glasses when working with pneumatics. Always check for humans and other objects in the path of the pistons, air, system, before turning on the compressor. Never turn on the compressor WITHOUT the pressure switch connected. Make sure that the release valve is open before turning on the compressor during initial setup. Wear ear protection. Exposure to excessive noise can damage hearing. Noise reducing mufflers can be fitted to machines to lessen the noise health hazard. Never use frayed, damaged or deteriorated hoses. Always store hoses properly and away from heat sources or direct sunlight. A hose failure can cause serious injury. Hose Reels can decrease your chances of injury, as well as help hoses last longer. Potential Hazards Tank Shattering Hearing Damage (Loud Compressor) Solenoid Failure (Misfiring mechanism) PCM Failure (Lack of control or Pressure Feedback) Air Leak (This can force hoses to slip off fittings) "

	"content": "Setting up a pneumatic system can be a daunting task. This section will cover the basics of setting up a pneumatic system. It will cover the basics of the components and how to connect them. It will also cover the basics of how to setup the compressor and the PCM and how to test the system.\nGatherings the Components The first step in setting up a pneumatic system is to gather the components. The components are listed below:\nCompressor Release Valve Pressure Switch Pressure Gauge x2 Manual Release Valve Air Tank Pressure Regulator Solenoid Pneumatic Hose Fittings \u0026amp; Connectors Pneumatic Control Module (PCM) or Pneumatic Control Hub (PCH) Compressor The air compressor is the heart of the pneumatic system. It is the device that compresses the air and stores it in the air tank. The compressor is connected to the PCM and the PCM controls the compressor. Compressors will automatically run unless the pressure switch is above the set pressure limit. The compressor can also be manually turned on and off from the robot code. The PCM and the compressor are connected with a 12V power cable. The red and black wire spots are marked on the PCM or Hub.\nThis is a close up of the wiring for the compressor and the PCM.\nRelease Valve The release valve is used to release the pressure from the system. The release valve is a non-electrical system that will manually go off if the pressure switch is overridden. All excess air pressure over 125psi will be released automatically when tuned properly. This is checked and tested by the inspectors.Don\u0026rsquo;t wait until competition to find out that your release valve is not working. Test it before you get to competition and while initially putting the system together.\nThis is a close up of the release valve.\nPressure Switch The pressure switch is used to control the compressor. The pressure switch is connected to the PCM next the compressor. The pressure switch is used to turn the compressor on and off. The pressure switches\u0026rsquo; air port is connected to the system on the high pressure side. By default the pressure switch is set to 120 psi. The pressure switch should NOT be adjusted. This is checked and tested by the inspectors. If the pressure switch is adjusted, the team will have to replace it with a stock one.\nThis is a close up of the tubing and port connection for the pressure switch.\nPressure Gauge (High Side) Pressure guages help us (humans) see the current PSI of the system using an analog (not electrical analog) dial indicator. The pressure gauge is connected to the system on the high pressure side. The best way to be able to use it is to put it somewhere that you can see it. Many teams will connect a T fitting to the high pressure side and then connect the pressure gauge and the pressure switch to the T-fitting(s). This allows the pressure gauge to be easily seen and the pressure switch to be easily connected. If it is also located near the manual release valve, it can be used to check the pressure before releasing the valve.\nThis is a close up of the tubing and port connection for the pressure gauge.\nManual Release Valve The manual release valve is used to release the pressure from the system. The manual release valve is a non-electrical system that will manually go off if a lever is pulled or a ball valve is turned. All air pressure from the system will be released when the valve is opened. This is checked and tested by the inspectors. This is a safety feature that is required on all FRC robots that store compressed air. It should be easily accessible and easy to use after a match has ended.\nThis is a close up of the manual release valve.\nAir Tank The air tank(s) are also located on the high side of the system. The tanks with either have a 1/4\u0026quot; NPT port or a threaded port to attach your own connectors. Whenever you are adding a new fitting, or removing an existing one, on a tank you need to:\nMake sure the tank is empty Wrap the threads with Teflon tape Tighten the fitting (Don\u0026rsquo;t over tighten) Check for leaks with a low pressure fill test before adding to your full system Add soap and water to an old spray bottle and spray the fittings to check for leaks. If you see bubbles, you have a leak. This is a close up of the tubing and port connection for the air tank.\nPressure Regulator The pressure regulator is what sets the PSI level for the low side of the system. Best practice is to set the pressure regulator to 60 psi. Solenoids can operate at more or less pressure by adjusting the regulator. Most regulators have a knob that can be turned to adjust the pressure. In order to adjust it you have to first pull up on the knob and then turn it. Clockwise increases the pressure and counter-clockwise decreases the pressure. The pressure regulator has an input side and an output side. Make sure which is which! The input side is sometimes marked with an triangle like in the picture below. The input side is the side that is connected to the high pressure side of the system. The output side is the side that is connected to the low pressure side of the system.\nThis is a close up of a pressure regulator.\nSolenoid In order to control the flow of air we use a special type of valve called a solenoid. Solenoids are controlled by the PCM or PCH. The solenoid has a port on the input side and a port on the output side. The PCM or PCH will send a signal to the solenoid to open or close the valve. The solenoid will open or close the valve depending on the signal it receives. The red and black wire spots are marked on the PCM or Hub. The block underneath the solenoid is called a manifold. The manifold is used to connect the air ports to the solenoid.\nThis is a close up of a solenoid and manifold.\nPneumatic Hose There are many vendors that sell the proper hose for pneumatic systems. The hose is measured by the inside diameter (ID) and the outside diameter (OD). The OD is the size of the hose and the ID is the size of the port that it connects to. The OD of the hose should be 1/4\u0026quot; and the ID of the port should be 1/4\u0026quot;. The hose should be flexible and not kink easily. The hose should be able to withstand the pressure of the system (125 psi MAX). Below is a table with the different types of hose and their pressure ratings with a column for the vendor with a link to the product page:\nVendor Hose Type Pressure Rating Link McMaster-Carr Polyurethane 150 PSI Link AndyMark Polyurethane 125 PSI Link AndyMark Polyurethane 116 Official/125 Tested PSI Link VEX Polyurethane Not Listed PSI Link Fittings \u0026amp; Connectors Fittings and connectors can vary wildly from vendor to vendor.

They are easy to use and can be used with a wide variety of hose. 1/4\u0026quot; NPT to 1/4\u0026quot; NPT to 1/4\u0026quot; NPT (T Connector) 1/4\u0026quot; NPT to 1/4\u0026quot; NPT to 1/4\u0026quot; NPT fittings are used to connect the hose to the ports. They are easy to use and can be used with a wide variety of hose. There are also smaller types of fittings that are typically used for the solenoids. These are typically 1/8\u0026quot; NPT fittings. These are typically used for the solenoids and are not typically used for the main air lines. They can have a smaller diameter hose and are typically used only on the low pressure side of the system.\nUsing all of the combinations of fittings and connectors, you can create a wide variety of pneumatic systems. Your team will need to figure out what works best for your team\u0026rsquo;s unique hardware setup. Below are some example pneumatic fitting images in the context of FRC to help you get started:\nThis is an example of \u0026ldquo;The Fitting Type\u0026rdquo; connecting \u0026ldquo;__ \u0026amp; __ \u0026quot;\nThis is an example of \u0026ldquo;The Fitting Type\u0026rdquo; connecting \u0026ldquo;__ \u0026amp; __ \u0026quot;\nThis is an example of \u0026ldquo;The Fitting Type\u0026rdquo; connecting \u0026ldquo;__ \u0026amp; __ \u0026quot;\nThis is an example of \u0026ldquo;The Fitting Type\u0026rdquo; connecting \u0026ldquo;__ \u0026amp; __ \u0026quot;\nThis is an example of \u0026ldquo;The Fitting Type\u0026rdquo; connecting \u0026ldquo;__ \u0026amp; __ \u0026quot;\nConnecting the PCM or PCH to the RoboRIO and PDP Finally we can go through the process of connecting up the PCM or PCH to the RoboRIO and PDP. The PCM or PCH is connected to the RoboRIO and PDP using a 2 wire daisy chain commonly used in FRC called CAN. CAN or Controller Area Network is a serial bus that is used to connect multiple devices together. The RoboRIO and PDP are both CAN devices and the PCM or PCH is also a CAN device. You can support up to 63 CAN devices on a single CAN bus. most devices in the system will have 2 seperate Channels for in and out, except the Roborio which is a special case. The Roborio is always the starting point of your CAN connection in FRC.\nIn logical order the wiring for CAN should always go like this: RoboRIO -\u0026gt; (Other CAN devices) -\u0026gt; PCM or PCH -\u0026gt; (Other CAN devices) -\u0026gt; PDP (have the termimating resistor jumper active on the PDP)\nIn a system with no other CAN components, like CAN motor controllers or sensors, the PCM or PCH is connected to the RoboRIO and PDP using the following diagram:\nThis is a close up of the PCM or PCH to the RoboRIO and PDP. Note: The process is the same for both! This diagram was made in Fritzing. I dont have a PCH fritzings part so I used the PCM part. The PCH is the same as the PCM for CAN connection.\nThe power connections for the PCM or PCH are as follows:\nBattery Positive -\u0026gt; Breaker -\u0026gt; PDP Positive -\u0026gt; Roborio and PCM/PCH Positive through their dedicated and marked ports\nBattery Negative -\u0026gt; PDP Negative -\u0026gt; Roborio and PCM/PCH Negative through their dedicated and marked ports\n"

	"content": "Pneumatic control is the process of controlling the flow of air to the pneumatic system. This is done by using solenoids to control cylinders of various shapes and sizes. All of the cylinders are controlled using the same basic hardware. At a minimum, if you have followed along you should have a compressor, a pressure switch, a release valve, and a solenoid. The solenoid is the only part of the system that is controlled by the robot. The compressor and solenoids are controlled by the PCM/PCH. The pressure switch stops the compressor if it detects anything above 125 psi. In case that fails there should ALWAYS be a mechanical safety valve that is properly tuned.\nWithout diving into the code portion yet, let\u0026rsquo;s look at the hardware. The solenoid is the only part of the system that is controlled by the robot so far. The compressor will just automatically run nonstop until a certain max PSI limit is reached. This assumes there is code for enabling the compressor somewhere in your code. A guide for this including with the changes for 2023 is here for Java and C++.\nControlling the Different Solenoids via Code There are two different types of solenoids that are used in FRC. The first is the single solenoid. This is the most basic solenoid and is used to control airflow in a single direction. The second is the double solenoid. This is used to control two different directions of airflow. Both have some basic commands for controlling them. This is an example from wpilib for the single solenoid. An example for the double solenoid is here.\nOperating the Solenoids Manually (Without Full Code) NOTE: You still need to have the rest of your system enabled and controlled with the PCM/PCH properly. This is just a way to manually control the solenoids without having to write code for it. This is useful for testing and debugging.\nMany of the FRC solenoids feature a button on their top. When this is pressed it forces the solenoid to change the direction of the air flow. This should be done with EXTREME CAUTION as you will be right next to the solenoid, and given the laws of space and time, probably near the cylinder you\u0026rsquo;re gonna set off.\nThe button on the top of the solenoid is used to manually change the direction of the air flow.\nControlling the Air Compressor in Code with Better Feedback By using an analog pressure sensor, teams can get much more detailed information about the pressure in the system. This allows for more accurate control of the system. This is especially important for teams that are using a compressor that is not controlled by the PCM/PCH. This is a guide for using the analog pressure sensor in Java and C++.\n"

	"content": " Sometimes things dont work as expected. This section will help you troubleshoot your pneumatic system.\nCommon Issues with Pneumatics Pneumatic solenoids are not working Check the solenoid wiring. Is the solenoid wired to the PCM? Is the solenoid wired to the correct channel? Is the solenoid wired with the correct polarity? Check the solenoid. Is the solenoid plugged in? Is the solenoid broken? If using a manifold, check the manifold for a proper seal If its a double solenoid, check they are both not firing at the same time Check the PCM. Is the PCM powered? The PCM is connected to the PDP and there is a small 20A fuse on the PDP for it and the VRM to share. Check the status of this fuse. Is the PCM wired to the correctly via CAN? Does it have the proper CAN ID? The PDP and PCM should ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS have the same CAN ID of 0! All of the FRC libraries assume this ID setup! Is the PCM firmware up to date? A guide to updating the PCM firmware can be found here as well as a general primer to CTRE CAN devices. For more specifics about troubleshooting for the PCM check here Is the system enabled? Check the code to make sure the system is enabled. Check the dashboard to make sure the system is enabled. Is the Robot Status Light flashing or solid? If flashing, the robot is enabled If solid, the robot is disabled but powered on. If off, the robot is not powered on. Is the system full with enough air to move the cylinder? Check the pressure gauge to make sure the system is full. Check the pressure regulator to make sure the low side level is set to around 60 psi for most teams. Pneumatic solenoids are not firing at the same time Check the Previoisly mentioned items for the solenoids. Check the code to make sure the solenoids are firing at the same time. If using a double solenoid, only use one k.direction command at a time. Check where the solenoids are being fired from. If they are being fired from different commands they will never truly be firing at the same time. The command scheduler will only run one command at a time for a subsytem. If you want to fire both solenoids at the same time, you will need to fire them from the same command. If using a timed robot, check that whatever functions are firing the solenoids are not being called seperately. If they are, they will not be firing at the same time. Are both solenoids using the same types of fitting and length of tubing? If not, the solenoids will not be firing at the same time. The solenoids will be firing at different times depending on the length of tubing and the fittings used. a. The amount of air needed to move the cylinder is dependent on the length of tubing and the fittings used. There are specifically fittings with screw caps that let you fine tune the pressure for each solenoid or cylinder. If yes, check for any physical leaks on the solenoids or the tubing connections. a. Get an old bottle with a spray nozzle and spray a SMALL amount soapy water on the connections. If bubbles appear, there is a leak. The System is Never \u0026ldquo;Full\u0026rdquo; and the Compressor Runs Forever Check the pressure gauges on both sides of the system (high and low pressure) If the low pressure gauge is reading 0 psi, the pressure regulator may be setup incorrectly. Check the direction of the pressure regulator. The high side is the inlet and the low side is the outlet. Check the low side pressure. It should be around 60 psi for most teams. If the high pressure gauge is reading 0 psi, the system is not full and has no air stored. Check that all manual valves are closed. Check all pneumatic fittings for leaks. Check the connections to the compressor for the release valve and the pressure switch. Check the pressure switch. If it is broken, the compressor may NEVER turn off. The System is Full but the Compressor Runs Intermittenly at Rest NOTE: Some air loss is unavoidable. The compressor will run to keep the system full. If the system is full and the compressor is running anyways, this is NOT normal. Check the pressure gauges on both sides of the system (high and low pressure) Check for leaks at all connection points. Check the connections to the compressor for the release valve and the pressure switch. If the release valve is not tuned properly it may be letting air out of the system too early. If the pressure switch has a loose connection or is broken, the compressor may operate intermittently. The PCM has a Sticky Fault Check the PCM for a sticky fault. Check the phoenix tuner self test. There is a clear sticky fault button on the self test menu! I have no idea if this can happen to the PCH but phoenix is only for CTRE products so I am assuming not. Check the status light on the PCM. Whats a sticky fault? A sticky fault is a fault that is not cleared by the code. This means that the code is not telling the PCM to clear the fault. This can happen if the code is not running or if the code is not telling the PCM to clear the fault. This can also happen if the PCM is not wired to the CAN bus properly. What makes it sticky? A sticky fault is a fault that is not cleared easily with a reboot. The PCM is Connected, I Can See it\u0026rsquo;s Proper Firmware version, but the Compressor Doesn\u0026rsquo;t Run Check the status light on the PCM. If the status light is flashing, the PCM is enabled. If the status light is solid, the PCM is disabled. If the status light is off, the PCM is not powered. Check the code to make sure the compressor is enabled. With the introduction of the new PCM firmware, the compressor enable command is NOT the traditional setClosedLoopControl(true) command. The new command is setDigitalEnable(true) for Java. Another new deprecated command is enabled(). This function checked the status of the compressor. Now it is called isEnabled() for clarity. Check the WPIlib documentation for more information here The PCM is Connected, I Can See it\u0026rsquo;s Proper Firmware version, but the Solenoids Don\u0026rsquo;t Fire Check the status light on the PCM. If the status light is flashing, the PCM is enabled. If the status light is solid, the PCM is disabled. If the status light is off, the PCM is not powered. Check the code to make sure the solenoids are set to the proper port number and PneumaticsModuleType. With the introduction of the new PCM firmware, the commands for setting up the solenoid objects are not the same as the old PCM firmware either. The new commands are Solenoid exampleSolenoidPCM = new Solenoid(PneumaticsModuleType.CTREPCM, 1); for a PCM, or Solenoid exampleSolenoidPH = new Solenoid(PneumaticsModuleType.REVPH, 1); for a PCH. With the introduction of the new PCM firmware, the commands for setting up the double solenoids are not the same as the old PCM firmware either. The new commands are DoubleSolenoid exampleDoublePCM = new DoubleSolenoid(PneumaticsModuleType.CTREPCM, 1, 2); for a PCM, or DoubleSolenoid exampleDoublePH = new DoubleSolenoid(9, PneumaticsModuleType.REVPH, 4, 5); for a PCH.

	"content": "What is Fusion 360? Fusion 360 is a 3D Design, CAM, and CAE tool from Autodesk. It is a cloud-based tool that allows you to design, simulate, and manufacture your robot. It is available for free to all FIRST Robotics Competition teams. Students and Mentors should sign up for a free account at https://www.autodesk.com/education/edu-software/overview?sorting=featured\u0026amp;filters=individual. After you setup or activate the Fusion 360 Educational access you should download it from https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/students-teachers-educators. You can also download the Fusion 360 app for your mobile device from the app store.\nWhat are some of the Pros and Cons of Fusion 360 vs. other CAD tools? Pros Cons Free for all FIRST Robotics Competition teams Cloud-based Available on Windows \u0026amp; Chromebooks Collaboration is easy File Viewer available for iOS and Android Cloud-based Teams Setup can be confusing How do I get started with Fusion 360? 1. Download Fusion 360 Download Fusion 360 from https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/students-teachers-educators. You can also download the Fusion 360 app for your mobile device from the app store.\n2. Install Fusion 360 Install Fusion 360 on your computer. You can also install the Fusion 360 app on your mobile device to view your designs on the go.\n3. Sign into your Fusion 360 account Sign into your Fusion 360 account. Double check that you are signed into the correct account. If you are not signed into the correct account, you can sign out and sign back in with the correct account. The fusion 360 Education account is different from the Personal account and has much more functionality. Your files and team connections will be different for each account as well.\n4. Create a new Fusion 360 Team or join an existing team If you are creating a new team, you will need to create a new team name. If you are joining an existing team, you will need to know the team name. The educator in charge of the \u0026ldquo;license seats\u0026rdquo; should also send a team invite email to make the process smoother, but it is not required.\nYou can always join a team later if you are not sure what team you are on. You can also create a new team later if you are not sure what team you are on or want to seperate your projects and work spaces with different organizations.\n5. Create a new Fusion 360 Project Create a new Fusion 360 Project. You can create a new project for each year or for each project. You can also create a new project later if you are not sure what project you are working on just yet. When making a new project, you can choose what to name it, where it is stored and more. If you dont know what to name it, you can always change it later, but you should know what you intend to make before you start trying to make it. \u0026ldquo;Robot Ideas\u0026rdquo; is a good name for a project that you are just starting to work on. \u0026ldquo;Robot 2023\u0026rdquo; is a good name for a project that you are working on for the 2023 season. \u0026ldquo;Robot 2023 - Chassis\u0026rdquo; is a good name for a project that you are working on for the 2023 season and is just for the chassis.\n6. Create a new Fusion 360 Design Create a new design by clicking on the + at the top of the screen. If you just opened Fusion 360 it opens with a new empty design called Untitled by default. You cannot import any outside parts or components into that design until you save it somewhere and give it a proper name.\nImporting parts and components into a design is covered in the next section. One other thing to note about your design before you make anything is to double check the Document Settings: units value to make sure its in whatever system you prefer (Metric or Standard).\n7. Import parts and components into your design If teams think ahead they can put all 3rd party vendor files into organized folders and then import them into their design. This will save a lot of time and effort later on. If you are just starting out, you can import parts and components into your design as you need them. You can also import parts and components into your design later if you are not sure what you need just yet.\nIf you are uploading a new part to Fusion 360, you can upload it from your computer by hitting the Upload button, then either browsing or dragging and dropping the files. Fusion is best at handling NON-MESH files like STEP. It can handle many types, but meshes like STL, OBJ, and FBX are not as good and will slow fusion to a crawl on even the beefiest of gaming computers.\nIf you are importing a part from a vendor, you should try to keep the original part names for the files. Vendors like McMaster-Carr and REV Robotics have a lot of similar parts and it is easier to find them if you know the part number.\nHow can I find a vendor part STEP file to even import? NOTE: every vendor has a different process for this. This is just a general overview of how to find a STEP file for a part. If you are having trouble finding a STEP file for a part, ask your mentor or a team member who has done it before. FRC discord and Chief Delphi are great places to ask for help also.\nVendor CAD Resources Link AndyMark (STEP Files) https://www.andymark.com/pages/resources-files?prefix=STEP%20Files/ AndyMark (2D Drawings) https://www.andymark.com/pages/resources-files?prefix=PDF%20Drawings/ VEX Robotics https://www.vexrobotics.com/pro/all/?q=empty\u0026amp;vex_site=cads VEX Robotics (Solidworks Partnership Search) https://www.3dcontentcentral.com/Search.aspx?arg=FRC\u0026amp;SortBy=match\u0026amp;PageSize=10\u0026amp;contentsourcefilter=Supplier%7CPlastic%20Supplier%7C-UserSupplied%20(SupplierAgent)%7CUser\u0026amp;suppliernavigator=VEX%20Robotics REV Robotics (CAD General) https://docs.revrobotics.com/docs/rev-ion#cad REV Robotics (Solidworks Partnership Page) https://www.3dcontentcentral.com/parts/supplier/REV-Robotics.aspx 9. Making a plate for the Power Breaker in Fusion 360 Step 1: Import the Power Breaker STEP file into your design. This one is tricky to find so im going to link download a copy I have hosted here. This one originally came from here.\nStep 2: Create a new sketch on the bottom face of the Power Breaker. This is the face that has the 4 holes for the screws. NOTE: Only 2 of the holes are used for the screws. The other 2 are for the Battery Positive line. You can ignore those holes.\nThis is what the sketch should look like. The sketch is a 2D representation of one face of the 3D model. You can see the 3D model in the background. The sketch is on the \u0026ldquo;bottom face\u0026rdquo; of the 3D model.\nStep 3: Select both screws by Ctrl + Clicking on them. Then clicking on the drop down at the bottom of the create tab, select the \u0026ldquo;Project\u0026rdquo; option near the bottom of the list. This will project the edges and lines that make up our bolt holes onto the sketch. This is a very useful tool for making holes in plates and other parts from existing 3D models.\nStep 4: Add a centered rectangle around the middle of the breaker. This is still part of the same sketch. For this short example you can just eyeball the center of the breaker. For more complex parts you can draw center lines or project more edges to get midpoints.\nStep 5: The size of the plate should leave plenty of room for easy safety access and leaving enough room for bolts with even a really thin material.\nStep 6: Finish the sketch by clicking the check mark at the top of the screen. This will take you back to the 3D design mode with your sketch visible. Now we can select the rectangle and extrude it out to make the plate. Note the extra pieces from the edges might get selected. You want the entire rectangle to be highlighted blue except for the holes. If you have extra pieces selected/unsleected, you can click on them with the Ctrl key held down to deselect/reselect them.\nStep 7: With the sketch of the plate selected still, click the \u0026ldquo;Extrude\u0026rdquo; button. This will bring up the extrude dialog. You can rotate the 3d model to get a better view of the Distance Arrow. As you drag it up and down, you can see the plate get thicker and thinner. You can also type in a value in the box. I used 0.25 inches since this is a fairly thick size that works for even the weakest of materials. You also need to check the Operation section carefully. There are 5 options all with different purposes.\nNew Body - This will create a new part in your design. This is useful if you want to make a new part from a sketch. You can also use this to make a new part from a 3D model. This is what we want to do here. New Component - This will create a new part in your design. This is useful if you want to make a new part from a sketch. You can also use this to make a new part from a 3D model. This is not what we want to do here. Cut - This will cut out the shape of the sketch from the part. This is useful if you want to make a hole in a part. This is not what we want to do here. Cut - This will cut out the shape of the sketch from the part. This is useful if you want to make a hole in a part. This is not what we want to do here. Join - This will add the shape of the sketch to the existing part part. This is not what we want to do here. Step 8: Click the \u0026ldquo;OK\u0026rdquo; button to finish the extrusion. This will create a new part in your design. You can see the new part in the tree on the left side of the screen. You can also see the new part in the 3D view. The part will be under Bodies and given a default name. You can rename it by double clicking on it in the tree or right clicking on it and selecting \u0026ldquo;Rename\u0026rdquo;. You can also convert it to a component by right clicking on it and selecting \u0026ldquo;Create Component from Bodies\u0026rdquo;. Finally if you did turn it into a component you could now export it, send a copy to a team mate or even convert the body inside of our component into a STL to be 3d printed.\n// TODO: Add a step for adding a hole for the battery positive lines.\n!!!YOU JUST MADE YOUR FIRST PART IN FUSION 360!!!\n"

The theme is also responsive, so it looks good on mobile devices. With this theme, we can focus on the content and not the design. Since the focus is on knowledge and information, the design is secondary. The biggest benefit of using Hugo and other SSG (static site generators) is new \u0026#34;posts\u0026#34; can be added to the site without having to rebuild the entire site. This makes it easy to add new content and keep the site up to date. If you are interested in learning about writing content for this site, please see the [Writing Content](/about/writing-content/) page. How do I write a page of markdown for FRC0? Its pretty simple. The first section is called the \u0026ldquo;Front Matter\u0026rdquo;. It is used to define the title and date of the page. The rest of the page is the content. The content is written in markdown. Try to keep the content to 1-2 paragraphs per section. This makes it easier to read and understand. I would also recommend using a plain text editor like Notepad++ or Visual Studio Code. These editors have plugins that make it easy to write markdown. Once you have new content ready to go, you can submit a pull request to our github with your new markdown content. We will review the content and add it to the site accordingly.\n"

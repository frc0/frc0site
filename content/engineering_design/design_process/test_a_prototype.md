Testing the prototype that you created is an important step in the design process. It allows you to make sure that the prototype works as expected. It also allows you to make changes to the prototype early in the design process. This will save you time and money in the long run. Time in the FRC season is very limited, so you should make sure that you are spending your time wisely. The testing process will also help you be ready for inspection at the competition. You should test your prototype as often as possible. You should also test your prototype in as many different situations as possible. This will help you find any problems with the prototype before you have to use it in a competition.

## What to Test

| **Test** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Functionality** | This test checks to make sure that the prototype works as expected. |
| **Safety** | This test checks to make sure that the prototype is safe to use. |
| **Appearance** | This test checks to make sure that the prototype looks good. |
| **Durability** | This test checks to make sure that the prototype is durable. |
| **Cost** | This test checks to make sure that the prototype is cost effective. |
| **Weight** | This test checks to make sure that the prototype is not too heavy. |
| **Size** | This test checks to make sure that the prototype is not too big. |
| **Quality** | This test checks to make sure that the prototype is of high quality and accurate. |

## How to Test

### Functionality

The functionality test checks to make sure that the prototype works as expected. Functionality is a wishy-washy term, so you should be more specific. For example, if you are testing a drivetrain, you should test the following:

- Does the drivetrain move forward?
- Does the drivetrain move backward?
- Does the drivetrain turn left?
- Does the drivetrain turn right?
- Does the drivetrain work at extreme speeds?
- What is the maximum controllable speed?

### Safety

The safety test checks to make sure that the prototype is safe to use. Safety is crucial and should be a top priority. You should test the following:

- Is the prototype safe to use?
- Are there any sharp edges?
- Are there any pinch points?
- Are there moving parts that should be covered?
- Are there any parts that could break off and cause injury?
- Are there any parts that could break off and cause damage to the robot?
- Are there any parts that could break off and cause damage to the field?
- Are there any parts that could break off and cause damage to other robots?
- Are there any parts that could break off and cause damage to the audience?

### Appearance

The appearance test checks to make sure that the prototype looks good. Appearance is important, but it is not as important as functionality and safety. You should test the following:

- Does the prototype look good?
- Does the prototype look professional?
- If it is a branded part, does it look correct and professional?
- If it has sponsor logos, do they look correct and professional?
- If its painted or powder coated, does it need retouching?
- If it is a 3D printed part, is it smooth and free of layer lines?

### Durability

The durability test checks to make sure that the prototype is durable. Durability means the ability to withstand wear and tear. You should test the following:

- How long does the prototype last? (Assuming you have multiple prototypes)
- What is the maximum amount of force that the prototype can withstand?
- What is the maximum amount of stress that the prototype can withstand?
- What is the maximum amount of weight that the prototype can support?
- What are the weakest points of the prototype?
- What are the strongest points of the prototype?
- How does the prototype hold up in extreme conditions?

### Cost

The cost test checks to make sure that the prototype is cost effective. Cost effectiveness means that the prototype is cheap to make and cheap to use. You should test the following:

- How much does it cost to make the prototype?
- If parts need to be purchased, how much do they cost?
- How often will parts need to be replaced?
- How much do those parts cost?
- How can we use prototype parts in the final robot?
- How can we use prototype parts in future robots?

### Weight

The weight test checks to make sure that the prototype is not too heavy. Weight is important because it affects the robot's performance and there is a legal weight limit. You should test the following:

- How much does the prototype parts weigh individually?
- How much does the prototype weigh as a whole?
- How much does the prototype weigh compared to other versions of the prototype?
- How can weight be reduced?
- How can weight be redistributed?
- How can weight be added?

### Size

The size test checks to make sure that the prototype is not too big. Size is important because it affects the robot's performance and there is a legal size limit. You should test the following:

- How big are the prototype parts individually?
- How big is the prototype as a whole?
- Do the parts fit in the robot?
- Do the parts fit together?
- How can size be reduced?
- How can parts be combined to reduce size?
- What is size of bolt holes and other mounting points compared to other parts?

### Quality

The quality test checks to make sure that the prototype is of high quality and accurate. Quality is important because it affects the robot's performance. You should test the following:

- How accurate is the prototype?
- How accurate is the prototype compared to other versions of the prototype?
- How accurate is the prototype compared to the CAD model?
- How accurate is the prototype compared to the design specifications?
- Can the prototype be improved?
- How can the assembly process be improved?
- How can the design process be improved?
- How can the manufacturing process be improved?
- What is the quality of the prototype compared to other parts of the robot?

## Testing Tips

- Test the prototype as often as possible.
- Test the prototype in as many different situations as possible.
- Test the prototype in extreme conditions.
- Test the prototype in extreme situations.
- Test the prototype in extreme environments.
- Test the prototype in extreme temperatures.
- Document the results of the tests.

### Documenting the Tests and Results

![Testing a Prototype](/images/engineering_design/design_process/mythbuster-science.gif)

There are so many easy ways to document the tests and results. You can use a notebook, a spreadsheet, a word document, or a wiki. You can also use a combination of these methods. You should document the following:

- What was tested?
- What was the result?
- What was the expected result?
- When was the test performed?
- Who performed the test?
- What was the test environment?
- Can the test be repeated?
- What was the test procedure?
- What tools and equipment were used?

After you have documented the tests and results, you should analyze the data and [communicate the results](/engineering_design/design_process/communicate_the_results) with the team.

## Why is it important to communicate the results?

Communicating the results of the design process is important because it allows you to share your ideas with others. It also allows you to get feedback on your ideas. This feedback can help you improve your design. Communicating the results of the design process is also important because it means you have your data organized in a way that is easy to understand. If the design has been that thoroughly analyzed, it is likely that many of the basic design flaws will be caught before the final product is built before getting feedback from others.

## How do you communicate the results?

There are many ways to communicate the results of the design process. The most common way is to write a report. The report should include the following:

- **Introduction** - This section should include a brief description of the problem that you are trying to solve. It should also include a brief description of the solution that you are proposing. This section should also include a brief description of the design process that you used to solve the problem.
- **Background Research** - This section should include a brief description of the research that you did to learn more about the problem that you are trying to solve. It should also include a brief description of the research that you did to learn more about the solution that you are proposing. This section should also include a brief description of the research that you did to learn more about the design process that you used to solve the problem.
- **Design Process** - This section should include a brief description of the design process that you used to solve the problem. It should also include a brief description of the design process that you used to learn more about the solution that you are proposing. This section should also include a brief description of the design process that you used to learn more about the design process that you used to solve the problem.
- **Results** - This section should include a brief description of the results that you got from the design process. It should also include a brief description of the results that you got from the design process. This section should also include a brief description of the results that you got from the design process.
- **Conclusion** - This section should include a brief description of the conclusions that you made from the design process. It should also include a brief description of the conclusions that you made from the design process. This section should also include a brief description of the conclusions that you made from the design process.

### Example Report

Here is an example of a report that you could write to communicate the results of the design process:

> **Introduction**
>
> The problem that I am trying to solve is to make a robot that can pick up a ball and put it in a cup. The solution that I am proposing is to use a robot arm to pick up the ball and put it in the cup. I used the design process to solve this problem.
>
> **Background Research**
>
> I did some research to learn more about the problem that I am trying to solve. I learned that there are many different types of robots. I also learned that there are many different types of robot arms. In my research I found that arms come in many DOF (degrees of freedom). The more joints, the more DOF and the more complex the arm is to build and control.
>
> To keep the design simple, I am proposing a 2 DOF arm. I chose a 2 DOF arm because it is simple to build and control. I also chose a 2 DOF arm because we have many of the parts needed in our inventory.
>
> **Design Process**
>
> In order to figure out what torque and speed I need for the motors, I used the design process to solve this problem. By using a planetary gear system, I was able to change the speed and torque of the motors with new ring sets as needed. The overall size of the gearbox stays the same, so it is easy to change the gear ratio without having to redesign the mounts.
>
> **Results**
>
> The results that I got from the design process are that the arm can pick up a ball and put it in a cup. The arm can also pick up a ball and put it in a cup. The arm can also pick up a ball and put it in a cup.
>
> However, the speed was too slow and we can reduce the amount of torque needed by using a better gear ratio.
>
> **Conclusion**
>
> The conclusions that I made from the design process are that the arm can pick up a ball and put it in a cup. The arm should be as simple as possible and the challenge could be solved with as few as 2 DOF. The arm's torque and speed can be adjusted by changing the gear ratio. This makes it simple to change the arm's torque and speed without having to redesign the mounts or the design at all.

## What are some other ways to communicate the results?

Below is a list of other ways that you can communicate the results of the design process:

| Method | Description | Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Presentation | A presentation is a way to communicate the results of the design process. | - It is easy to share your ideas with others. | - It is easy to get distracted. |
| Video | A video is a way to communicate the results of the design process. | - It is easy to share your ideas with others. | - It is easy to skip crucial parts. |

Now that you have learned about the design process, you can apply it to fix the new problems found with the prototype. This is called iteration or [repeating the design process](/engineering_design/design_process/repeat_the_design_process/).

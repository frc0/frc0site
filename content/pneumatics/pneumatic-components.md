Pneumatic components are the parts of a pneumatic system that use compressed air to do work. There are many different types of pneumatic components. The most common pneumatic components are shown in the table below:

| Component | Description | Image | Vendor Link(s) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Solenoid | A solenoid is a valve that uses an electric current to open and close. It is used to control the flow of air in a pneumatic system. Solenoids can be 12v or 24v. There is a jumper on the PCM for this!| ![Solenoid](/images/pneumatics/solenoid.jpg) | [Andymark](https://www.andymark.com/products/ckd-single-solenoid-valve-standalone?via=Z2lkOi8vYW5keW1hcmsvV29ya2FyZWE6OkNhdGFsb2c6OkNhdGVnb3J5LzViZDM0MWUzNjFhMTBkMjkyYzk2NDY2Zg) |
| Double Solenoid | A double solenoid is a valve that uses an electric current to open and close. It is used to control the flow of air in a pneumatic system. It has two ports, one for air in and one for air out. Solenoids of both kinds are usually attached to manifold| ![Double Solenoid](/images/pneumatics/double-solenoid.jpg) | [Andymark](https://www.andymark.com/products/ckd-double-solenoid-valve-2-position) |
| Compressor | A compressor is a device that uses an electric motor to compress air. It is used to provide the air pressure for a pneumatic system. Teams can prefill tanks with an offboard compressor board. It must still use the PCM as its controlling hardware. | ![Compressor](/images/pneumatics/compressor.jpg) | [Andymark](https://www.andymark.com/products/air-compressor?via=Z2lkOi8vYW5keW1hcmsvV29ya2FyZWE6OkNhdGFsb2c6OkNhdGVnb3J5LzViZWMyZjYwNjFhMTBkM2RiNDYxOGRmYg) |
| Pneumatic Cylinder | A pneumatic cylinder is a device that uses compressed air to extend and retract a piston. These can come in a wide variety of sizes and shapes. | ![Pneumatic Cylinder](/images/pneumatics/pneumatic-cylinder.jpg) | [Andymark](https://www.andymark.com/categories/pneumatics-cylinders) |
| Pneumatic Tank | A pneumatic tank is a device that stores compressed air. They don't all have to be plastic. There is not a limit on the capacity of your tanks, however they must be rated for higher than 125 PSI| ![Pneumatic Tank](/images/pneumatics/pneumatic-tank.jpg) | [Andymark](https://www.andymark.com/products/590-ml-air-reservoir-with-1-4-in-npt-ports?via=Z2lkOi8vYW5keW1hcmsvV29ya2FyZWE6OkNhdGFsb2c6OkNhdGVnb3J5LzViYzRhMmZmNjFhMTBkNGQyZTU4OGU0OA)|
| Pneumatic Fitting | A pneumatic fitting is a device that connects two pneumatic components together. Fittings can come in many different styles. There are splitters, T taps, and more!| ![Pneumatic Fitting](/images/pneumatics/pneumatic-fitting.jpg) | [Andymark](https://www.andymark.com/categories/pneumatics-fittings) |
| Pneumatic Hose | A pneumatic hose is a device that carries compressed air from one component to another. These can come in a variety of colors and styles. All of the ones for FRC are 1/4 inch in diameter.| ![Pneumatic Hose](/images/pneumatics/pneumatic-hose.jpg) | [Andymark](https://www.andymark.com/products/20-meters-of-pneumatic-tubing-1-4-in-od-polyurethane-black?via=Z2lkOi8vYW5keW1hcmsvV29ya2FyZWE6OkNhdGFsb2c6OkNhdGVnb3J5LzViZWMyZjYwNjFhMTBkM2RiNDYxOGRmYg) |
| Pressure Release Valve | A pressure release valve is a device that releases air pressure from a pneumatic system. There are several types of these used in FRC. There are levers, spring pulls and more. As long as it can safely vent air in a hurry!| ![Pressure Release Valve](/images/pneumatics/pressure-release-valve.jpg) | [Andymark](https://www.andymark.com/products/pressure-gauge-1-5-face-back-mount-1-8-npt-0-160-psi?via=Z2lkOi8vYW5keW1hcmsvV29ya2FyZWE6OkNhdGFsb2c6OkNhdGVnb3J5LzViZWMyZjYwNjFhMTBkM2RiNDYxOGRmYg)|
| Pressure Switch | A pressure switch is a device that detects when the air pressure in a pneumatic system is above or below a certain value. | ![Pressure Switch](/images/pneumatics/pressure-switch.jpg) | [Andymark](https://www.andymark.com/products/nason-pressure-switch?via=Z2lkOi8vYW5keW1hcmsvV29ya2FyZWE6OkNhdGFsb2c6OkNhdGVnb3J5LzViZWMyZjYwNjFhMTBkM2RiNDYxOGRmYg) |
| Pressure Gauge | A pressure gauge is a device that displays the air pressure in a pneumatic system. | ![Pressure Gauge](/images/pneumatics/pressure-gauge.jpg) | [Andymark](https://www.andymark.com/products/pressure-gauge-1-8-in-npt-0-160-psi-1?via=Z2lkOi8vYW5keW1hcmsvV29ya2FyZWE6OkNhdGFsb2c6OkNhdGVnb3J5LzViZWMyZjYwNjFhMTBkM2RiNDYxOGRmYg) |
| Analog Pressure Sensor | An analog pressure sensor is a device that converts the air pressure in a pneumatic system into an analog voltage. | ![Analog Pressure Sensor](/images/pneumatics/analog-pressure-sensor.jpg) | [Andymark](https://www.andymark.com/products/analog-pressure-sensor?via=Z2lkOi8vYW5keW1hcmsvV29ya2FyZWE6OkNhdGFsb2c6OkNhdGVnb3J5LzViZWMyZjYwNjFhMTBkM2RiNDYxOGRmYg) |
| Pressure Regulator | A pressure regulator is a device that controls the air pressure in a pneumatic system. | ![Pressure Regulator](/images/pneumatics/pressure-regulator.jpg) | [Andymark](https://www.andymark.com/products/pressure-regulator-gauge-with-1-4-in-press-in-tube-fittings?via=Z2lkOi8vYW5keW1hcmsvV29ya2FyZWE6OkNhdGFsb2c6OkNhdGVnb3J5LzViZWMyZjYwNjFhMTBkM2RiNDYxOGRmYg)|
| Pneumatic Control Module | A pneumatic control module is a device that controls the air pressure in a pneumatic system. | ![Pneumatic Control Module](/images/pneumatics/pneumatic-control-module.jpg) |[CTRE](https://store.ctr-electronics.com/pneumatic-control-module/), [Andymark](https://www.andymark.com/products/pneumatic-control-module?via=Z2lkOi8vYW5keW1hcmsvV29ya2FyZWE6OkNhdGFsb2c6OkNhdGVnb3J5LzViZWMyZjYwNjFhMTBkM2RiNDYxOGRmYg) |
| Pneumatic Hub | The Pneumatic Hub features 16 solenoid channels which allow for up to 16 single-acting solenoids, 8 double-acting solenoids, or a combination of the two types. | ![Pneumatic Hub](/images/pneumatics/pneumatic-hub.webp) | [REV](https://www.revrobotics.com/rev-11-1852/) |

# 7.0 Computer Aided Design

CAD or Computer Aided Design helps teams design their robot. It is a great way to visualize the robot and to make sure that the robot is designed correctly. CAD is also a great way to share the robot design with other teams and mentors. CAD is not required for the competition, but it is highly recommended. Software like Fusion 360, OnShape, and SolidWorks are all great options for teams to use. All 3 have free versions (For Educational use) that are great for teams to use. My personal favorite is Fusion 360 (Mr. Siefen's opinion). All of them have great tutorials and resources to help teams get started. The goal of this chapter is to help teams get started with CAD and to help teams learn how to use CAD to design FRC specific items and hardware.

Below is an outline of the topics that will be covered in this chapter.

#### &#x26A0; It's Crescendo Time! &#x26A0;

- The 2024 Season has officially kicked off! The game is called Crescendo, and the game manual is available [here](https://firstfrc.blob.core.windows.net/frc2024/Manual/2024GameManual.pdf).

- The game animation is available [here](https://youtu.be/9keeDyFxzY4?si=QVf2OAxZeceeyn4-).

- New to 2024 is the [KitBot](https://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/frc/kitbot) from FIRST. This is a great starting point for teams who are new to FRC or who want to focus on other aspects of the robot. Teams who opted into the Drive Base Kit received some parts in a black tote. Some you have to buy yourself. The list of parts is available [here](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc/blog/2023-2024-kitbot-shopping-list).

**URGENT FRC Blog Updates**

**1. Motor Rule Changes for the 2024 Season**
- Authored by: Jay O’Donnell, FIRST Robotics Competition Mechanical Engineer
- Summary: For the 2024 season, there's a change to the robot rules. Teams will be limited to four motors for robot movement (referred to as propulsion motors). Certain types of motors are excluded from this limitation. The change is intended to reduce robot collisions and ensure field durability while aiming to level the playing field for teams with various resources.

**2. Award Updates for the 2024 Season**
- Authored by: Fiona Hanlon, FIRST Robotics Competition Team Experience Specialist
- Highlights:
  - A reminder of award resources available to teams, including guidance for the Dean’s List Award, judging processes, and tips for interacting with judges.
  - Updates to the FIRST Impact Award Video: Videos will be a part of the submission process, and bringing a flash drive is no longer necessary. Videos are optional and are not a part of the official judging process.
  - Guidance for FIRST Impact Award Feedback: Teams can submit an optional question for feedback from event judges.
  - The Highest Rookie Seed Award will be discontinued.

## What's FRC Zero and How Can I Learn More About It?

FRC Zero is a knowledge base for students, mentors, and parents of FIRST Robotics Competition teams.  The goal of FRC Zero is to provide a single source of information for all things FIRST Robotics Competition.  This includes information on the game, the rules, the robot, and the competition and even important notices (See above). There are lessons, troubleshooting and hardware teardowns.  There are also videos and other resources to help you learn more about FRC. You can learn more about FRC Zero by reading the [about chapter](/about/).

FRC Zero is a work in progress.  We are always looking for new contributors to help us improve the site.  If you are interested in contributing, please see the [writing-content](/about/writing-content) page.

**URGENT FRC Blog Updates**

**1. Motor Rule Changes for the 2024 Season**
- Authored by: Jay O’Donnell, FIRST Robotics Competition Mechanical Engineer
- Summary: For the 2024 season, there's a change to the robot rules. Teams will be limited to four motors for robot movement (referred to as propulsion motors). Certain types of motors are excluded from this limitation. The change is intended to reduce robot collisions and ensure field durability while aiming to level the playing field for teams with various resources.

**2. Award Updates for the 2024 Season**
- Authored by: Fiona Hanlon, FIRST Robotics Competition Team Experience Specialist
- Highlights:
  - A reminder of award resources available to teams, including guidance for the Dean’s List Award, judging processes, and tips for interacting with judges.
  - Updates to the FIRST Impact Award Video: Videos will be a part of the submission process, and bringing a flash drive is no longer necessary. Videos are optional and are not a part of the official judging process.
  - Guidance for FIRST Impact Award Feedback: Teams can submit an optional question for feedback from event judges.
